# Script Inventory

This directory contains command-line entry points for the local coursework platform.
Official commands stay on `main` because README, deliverables, tests, Airflow/runtime
launchers, or reproducible evidence flows still reference them.

Do not move or delete a script from `main` unless its README, deliverable, test, DAG,
and runtime references have been removed or replaced in the same change.

## Convenience Make Targets

The repository also ships a root [Makefile](../Makefile) that provides a `make + verb` shortcut for the most common commands. It delegates to the official scripts below and to `scripts/ctl.py` for the Docker Compose lifecycle. The compose wrapper expands documented profile bundles and prebuilds shared images where needed, while the classification tables in this README remain the source of truth for which scripts are official.

| Make target | Underlying script or command |
| --- | --- |
| `make install` | `uv sync` |
| `make generate` | `scripts/generate/run_generator.py` (with `SCALE`, `MODE`, `SEED` variables) |
| `make generate-section03` | `scripts/generate/run_generator.py --config configs/generator/base.yaml` (with `SCALE` and `SEED`) |
| `make build-section03-dbt` | `scripts/analytics/run_section03_dbt.py --config configs/generator/base.yaml --scale SCALE` |
| `make test-section03` | `tests/unit/test_section03_drift.py` and `tests/integration/test_section03_generator.py` |
| `make build-dbt` | `uv run dbt build --project-dir infra/analytics/dbt --profiles-dir infra/analytics/dbt` |
| `make test` | `uv run pytest` |
| `make finalize` | `scripts/qa/finalize_sections_01_02.py` |
| `make reset` | `scripts/qa/reset_all.py` (forwards `RESET_FLAGS=...`) |
| `make up-<profile>` / `make down-<profile>` | `scripts/ctl.py compose up <profile>` / `scripts/ctl.py compose down <profile>` for `ingestion`, `lakehouse`, `batch`, `streaming`, `serving`, `orchestration`, `governance`, and `all`; dependent profiles expand to the documented staged bundles. |

Run `make help` at any time to print the full catalog.

## Classification Policy

| Class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `official-main` | Supported command or runtime entry point required by official docs, tests, DAG/runtime launchers, or evidence generation. |
| `develop-only candidate` | Debug, manual, duplicate, screenshot, or destructive helper with no current official references; queued for a later `develop` move. |
| `needs-review` | Documented or tested today, but risky/destructive enough that a human should decide before it moves or becomes fully official. |

## Develop-Only Candidates

These files are not currently referenced by official docs, tests, DAGs, or runtime launchers.
Keep them in this branch for now, but treat them as queued for a later `develop` move.

| Script | Why it is a `develop-only candidate` |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/kafka/cleanup_kafka.py` | Destructive Kafka reset helper; superseded by the documented project-level reset flow for official use. |
| `scripts/lakehouse/cleanup_lakehouse.py` | Destructive lakehouse service/evidence cleanup helper with no official references. |
| `scripts/pinot/capture_evidence.py` | Duplicate/manual Pinot evidence wrapper; official Pinot evidence refresh uses `scripts/pinot/refresh_evidence.py`. |
| `scripts/gke/manage_profile.py` | Topic 17 dry-run profile renderer retained for later GKE profile operations. |
| `scripts/qa/upload_bronze.sh` | Manual shell helper for copying local raw files into MinIO; official landing uses `scripts/lakehouse/land_bronze_batch.py`. |
| `scripts/spark/capture_evidence.py` | Duplicate/manual Spark evidence wrapper; official batch evidence is produced through `scripts/spark/run_batch.py`. |

## Needs Review

These scripts remain in place because they are referenced, but they are not ordinary
official run commands.

| Script | Risk to resolve before moving or normalizing |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/flink/cleanroom_verify.py` | Referenced by Flink and Pinot deliverables and tests, but performs clean-room reset, Docker service removal, volume removal, and image/build-cache pruning. |
| `scripts/gke/check_budget.py` | GKE external preflight and budget gate; it needs explicit cloud credentials and targets before use. |
| `scripts/gke/configure_evidence_ingress.py` | Temporary GKE evidence-ingress renderer/applicator; it needs an explicit context, lease, and human review. |
| `scripts/kind/preflight_edai2_lean.py` | Dedicated Kind smoke-cluster preflight; it validates the bounded local cluster before creation. |
| `scripts/qa/reset_all.py` | Referenced by README as the local reset command, but intentionally stops services, removes Docker volumes, and can clean gitignored local data. |

## Follow-Up

Official evidence helpers in `src/vina_bim_shop/*/evidence.py` and orchestration
runtime helpers now generate machine-verifiable artifacts only. Committed
`evidence/**/screenshots/` files remain historical review artifacts, but UI
screenshot capture/manual browser helpers should live on `develop` rather than in
the official `main` runtime path.
